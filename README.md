## About Me

I am a Data Scientist with a passion for data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. I love working on projects that involve solving real-world problems using data. I also achieved a TOP 5 rank in Kaggle competitions, showcasing my competitive edge and expertise in data science. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Deep Learning.



## My Projects

- **[Wine Quality Classification](https://github.com/BektenKozhonov/wine_quality_clasification/blob/main/wine_draft_classification.ipynb)**: Analyzing and predicting wine quality using logistic regression and Decision Trees. (2nd place on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/wine-quality-classification-challenge) Competition)
- **[Car Model Regression](https://github.com/BektenKozhonov/car-model-classification/blob/main/Car_final_draft.ipynb)**: Analyzing and predicting car price using linear regression and Decision Trees. (3rd place on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/car-valuation-competition) Competition)
- **[YouTube Analysis](https://github.com/BektenKozhonov/DS_getting_education/blob/main/project_youtube.ipynb)**: Analyzing and clustering features using K-means, DBSCAN, and EM.
- **[NeurIPS 2024 - Predict New Medicines with BELKA](https://github.com/BektenKozhonov/leash-BELKA/blob/main/leash-BELKA_OLIMPIAD.ipynb)**: The competition aims to develop machine learning models to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to proteins using a dataset that includes molecular structures in SMILES format and binding information with three proteins. Participants are encouraged to explore various chemical representations and predictive modeling techniques to optimize performance, evaluated by metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **[TolgonAI](https://github.com/BektenKozhonov/TolgonAI.git)**: This project is currently in the ideation stage and has the potential to grow into a real startup. TolgonAI is a voice assistant designed specifically for adults, offering psychological support and assistance. The aim is to provide accessible mental health resources through advanced AI technologies, improving the well-being and quality of life for users.
- **[Analyzing and Making prediction of appartment renting dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16Jw2rr0bjZ5_gKsKuGRgiFfKvPFgQgcj?usp=sharing)**: In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the apartment rental market in Kyrgyzstan and developed a predictive model to estimate rental prices based on geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). The approach combines exploratory data analysis with machine learning techniques to uncover spatial trends and provide accurate price forecasts, aiding decision-making for both renters and investors.
- **[Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e3FAyi5gcG6HmWCp31lX_L-sSvREOP9d?usp=sharing)**: This Kaggle competition challenges participants to predict daily rainfall using meteorological data. The goal is to build a binary classification model that accurately forecasts whether it will rain each day, evaluated using ROC AUC.
- **[NLP project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13ef-9k6hpvLj-X8jPc4_EYm0wJJvuuSZ?usp=sharing)**: In this project, I built my first natural language processing model using an LSTM layer implemented in PyTorch. The model was trained with the Adam optimizer, which enabled efficient parameter updates for text classification tasks. This project provided valuable insights into sequence modeling and set the foundation for more advanced NLP applications.
- **[MLP project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xin8IkxFPNaq1zslreUlj5LFboOTQVBE?usp=sharing)**: This project marks my first foray into building a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch. It walks through the entire processâ€”from data preprocessing and defining the network architecture to training the model with a suitable loss function and optimizer, and finally evaluating its performance. This hands-on project not only solidifies the fundamentals of feedforward neural networks but also sets the stage for exploring more advanced deep learning applications.
